            <hr>
            <strong>Introduction</strong>
            <p >
              
              We are committed to protecting your privacy and respecting your rights as a user of Booksense, our mobile application (“App”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets out how we collect, use, and disclose personal information that we may obtain through your use of Booksense. By using Booksense, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy.
            </p>

            
            <strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong>
            
            <p>
              We may collect personal information that you provide to us when you use Booksense, such as your name, email address, and a profile avatar. We may use this information to provide you with the services offered through Booksense, to communicate with you about Booksense, and to improve Booksense and our services.
              <br />
              <br />
              We may also collect technical information about your use of Booksense, such as your device type, operating system, and App usage data. We may use this information to analyze and improve Booksense and our services.
            </p>
              
            <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
            <p>
              We may share your personal information with third-party service providers who help us operate Booksense and provide our services. We may also disclose your personal information if required by law or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
            </p>
                
            <strong>Data Retention</strong>
              
            <p>
              We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
            </p>  
              
            <strong>Security</strong>
            <p>
              We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will be completely secure.

              If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your personal information. If you wish to be informed about what personal information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us.
            </p>
